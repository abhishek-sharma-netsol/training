      <p> FRISCO, TX (September 15, 2021) – Ryvals Inc, a global information and technology services provider, is pleased to announce it will be part of history as the first esports gaming company to send a product into space. Ryvals is honored to have commissioned a fully customized controller for the Inspiration4 mission. The Xbox® controller, custom built by Battle Beaver Customs specifically for the Inspiration4 mission, will be taken aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft by Inspiration4’s crew, where it will become the first video game controller to orbit earth. Following the Inspiration4 mission, the controller will be auctioned off for charity, with all proceeds benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.</p>
      <p> The Inspiration4 mission will be led by Jared Isaacman, the 38-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments, a Pennsylvania-based payment processing company. It will launch from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the famous embarkation point for Apollo and Space Shuttle missions, and it will travel on a multi-day journey that will continually eclipse more than 90% of the earth’s population. </p>
      <p> While the Inpiration4 mission will be the first all-civilian mission to orbit earth, the Inspiration4’s true mission is to raise awareness and funds for the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The Inspiration4 is tentatively scheduled to launch on September 15, 2021 at 8:00 PM EDT. The rocket launch can be live streamed on the official SpaceX website and YouTube channels. More information can also be found on Twitter for Inspiration4 (@inspiration4x) or SpaceX (@SpaceX). </p>
